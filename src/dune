; Removing the following warnings:
; - 50: unattached documentation comment, as it doesn’t fit the way we document our code.
; - 39: unused rec flag, as Coq generates a lot of these in its extraction.
; We could also remove the following, as Coq generates a lot of these in its extraction, but these are useful to track issues in the shim:
; - 20: this argument will not be used by the function.
; - 34: unused type
; - 32: unused value.
