# Release 2.0

This release for Wasm 2.0 implemented the following changes in the official spec release 2.0:
- Multiple-value blocks;
- Reference types;
- Table instructions;
- Multiple tables;
- Bulk memory and table instructions.

The new sign extension, non-trapping float-to-int conversion, and vector types are added but without any concrete implementation.

## Updated Components:
- [x] Base opsem/typing definitions;
- [x] Preservation theorems;
- [x] Interpreter and progress theorem;
- [x] Instantiation;
- [ ] Instantiation soundness theorems;
- [x] Type checker;
- [ ] Type checker correctness theorem;
- [x] Binary printer/parser;
- [x] Code pretty printer.

# Major Structural Changes

## Values vs Instructions
Due to the introduction of reference values, values are no longer necessarily basic instructions; function references and external references are expressed as administrative instructions due to their direct usage of store addresses instead of module indices. This change has broken some assumptions that many original proofs and definitions based on -- mostly those related to value typing (see below). 
Total and partial conversion operations are now provided for conversion between values and their corresponding instructions:
- `v_to_e/e_to_v` for total conversions;
- `e_to_v_opt` for partial operations.

## Value Typing and the Store
Due to the use of store addresses, the new reference values can only be typed given a store. This necessitated the introduction
of a separate `value_typing` relation with respect to a store. In addition, value typing relation now has to be done at the
`e_typing` level (for administrative instructions) as they can no longer be converted to basic instructions and typed using the `const` rule in `be_typing`. New value typing inversion lemmas were added to help reasoning with this change; search for terms involving `value_typing` and `values_typing`.

## Threads
Threads are now properly spelt out as a separate type that constitutes the configuration tuple. The old thread-related definitions (e.g. `s_typing`) are renamed to the names used in the standard (e.g. `thread_typing`).

## Type System and Subtyping
In addition, this release also implements subtyping introduced in the future funcret/GC proposal as a forward-looking move. There is currently no observable effect in Wasm 2.0 except for typing instructions past unconditional branches, as there is no non-trivial subtypings between any of the base value types. There exists a principal type (potentially with some free type parameters) for every value/instruction, which all possible types of it are supertypes of.
The largest impact of this type system change is that, in the future, values can no longer uniquely typed even if it is well typed. This is not the case in Wasm 2.0 yet, but examples can be introduced in future proposals.
The old `weakening` typing rules are replaced by a subtyping rule as a result of this change, which reflects the shift in the future proposals.

# Refactorings and Feature Improvements

## Host Formulation
The parametric host language is now defined using typeclasses. 
The main major benefit is the automatic filling of implicit host parameter, instead of needing to redefine all operations involving anything downstream from function instances and stores. The proof context is also greatly simplified since all these redefinitions no longer exist to occupy a major chunk of the buffer window.

## Numerics
- Refactored the old collection of conversion operations *cvtop* to be split up by their individual constructors to better match the spec.

## Name Changes
- Changed the name of some types, instructions, and constructors to better match the official spec.
- Instance indices are now simplified to the base `u32` type without additional constructors.

## Pretty Printer
- Implemented pretty printing for conversion operations.

## Typing
- Massively improved the scope and automation of the typing inversion lemmas.
- Provided a new tactic `resolve_e_typing` that automatically tries to resolve `e_typing` goals, dealing mostly with the operands.
- Provided a separate file for the new subtyping lemmas and tactics.

## Miscellaneous
- Introduced many additional excerpts in comments from the official spec for various definitions.

# Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the binary printer incorrectly prints all types of reinterpret conversions to 0xBC.
- Fixed a bug where the binary printer sometimes prints indices via a conversion to nat first.
