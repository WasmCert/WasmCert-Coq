# Release 2.0.1

This release is a cumulative update for the repository since the initial release for Wasm 2.0 features, including a bump on the dependency versions (now using Coq 8.19) and several refactorings and feature additions.

# Upgrade to Coq 8.19
The codebase is now updated to work with Coq 8.19. The other dependencies have also been upgraded correspondingly.

# Context interpreter refactoring
The context interpreter has been refactored to provide a more faithful version of the progress property.

# Bugfix for certain numeric operations
The behaviour of `shl_s` has been fixed according to the spec. Further tests are still required as the numerical part is severely under-tested.

# Added opaque implementation of vector instructions (SIMD)
Added the necessary instructions for the new 2.0 SIMD instructions to be parsed but without any concrete implementations. In a future version, add some hooks to the OCaml implementation of the reference interpreter to support concrete SIMD operations.

# Binary printer backwards-compatibility
Added an additional check in the binary printer that tries to provide 1.0-compatible binary modules when a Wasm module only used the features from the Wasm 1.0 semantics set.
