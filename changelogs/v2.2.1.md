# Release 2.2.0

## New Features
- Extended the persistent array interfaces to allow bulk update by byte generators. This should result in a slight speedup in memory operations.

## Refactorings
- Removed dependency on the Uint63 module. The persistent array module now uses OCaml's `int` instead, which is 63-bit on 64-bit OCaml.

## Bugfixes
- Corrected an errorneous type alias used in simd vector operations.

## Refactorings and Infrastructural Changes
- Extraction now extracts Coq's `String.string` to OCaml native `string` instead of `char list`. The signature of various interfaces are updated accordingly.
- Extraction now extracts Coq's binary integers (N/Z/positive) to ZArith's BigInt instead. The original conversion functions are therefore deprecated. New conversion functions between ZArith's BigInt and OCaml's native int are added. This is to avoid cyclic dependencies in the parametric SIMD implementations.
- The testing script `run_wast.sh` and the makefile now support testing a subset of the test suite by passing in a filter argument. For example: `make run_wast FILTER="simd"` runs only the simd tests.
