# Release 2.2.1

## New Features
- Extended the persistent array interfaces to allow bulk update by byte generators. This avoids creating redundant historic versions of memories and should result in a slight speedup in memory update operations.
- Added an experimental host in OCaml containing a clock function for running benchmarks.
- Normalised binary arithmetic import to `ZArith` only in all files that are part of the extraction.

## Improvements
- Improved extraction of several numeric operations which were missed due to having two integer moduels in the export (which might be hinting at a different problem under the hood).

## Refactorings
- Removed dependency on the Uint63 module. The persistent array module now uses OCaml's `int` instead, which is 63-bit on 64-bit OCaml. A shim file is added to facilitate conversion between the extracted integer type `Z.t` and `int` (since some of OCaml's `Array` operations only take `int` as arguments).

## Bugfixes
- Corrected an errorneous type alias used in simd vector operations.
- Fixed a bug where the signed LEB128 encoder mishandled negative integers whose magnitude occupies a multiple of 7 bits (https://github.com/WasmCert/WasmCert-Coq/issues/83).
