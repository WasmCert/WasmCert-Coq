# Release 2.2.1

## New Features
- Extended the persistent array interfaces to allow bulk update by byte generators. This avoids creating redundant historic versions of memories and should result in a slight speedup in memory update operations.

## Refactorings
- Removed dependency on the Uint63 module. The persistent array module now uses OCaml's `int` instead, which is 63-bit on 64-bit OCaml.

## Bugfixes
- Corrected an errorneous type alias used in simd vector operations.
