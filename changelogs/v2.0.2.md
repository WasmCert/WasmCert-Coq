# Release 2.0.2

## Upgrade to Coq 8.20
The codebase is now updated to work with Coq 8.20. The other dependencies have also been upgraded correspondingly. Note that we are currently using mathcomp version 1.x; this will possibly be updated in a future version.

## New features
- Added implementation of the saturating float-to-int instruction.
- The opsem rules for numeric instructions now require a type checking in addition to the numeric proxy operators (`unop/binop/...`).
  This type checking is redundant when the type system is enforced. Instead, this change makes the opsem more self-contained as a 
  standalone definition.

## Refactorings
- The subtyping definitions are now refactored into a standalone file `subtyping.v`, relocating from `operations.v`.
- The subtyping relation for function types is now changed to live in `Bool` instead of `Prop` due to its full computability.
- A new file `definitions.v` is added for importing all base definitions of the mechanisation without any proofs. This can be useful for
developments that only use the mechanised definitions but not the proofs.

## Bugfix
- Fixed a bug where the signatures of the returned values are incorrect for certain float-to-int conversions.
- Fixed a bug where the binary parser incorrectly parse the order of arguments of the `table.init` instruction (should be reversed).

# Feature Improvements
- Improved the error message when an export function with arguments are invoked (currently not supported).
