# Release 2.1.0

## New Features
- Added the tail call feature extension proposal. This has not been tested against the test suite since the reference `.wast` parser doesn't implement it as part of the standard yet.

## Miscellaneous
- `invert_e_typing` now deals with `thread_typing` as well. Some of the old typing inversion code can be simplfied as a result.
- The lookup notation `!!` in `instantiation_properties.v` is now declared within a notation scope `lookup_scope`.
