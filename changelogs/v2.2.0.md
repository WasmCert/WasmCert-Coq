# Release 2.2.0

## New Features
- Implemented SIMD execution via eval functions in the reference implementation. The extracted runtime now pass the full Wasm 2.0 test suite.

## Refactorings and Infrastructural Changes
- Extraction now extracts Coq's `String.string` to OCaml native `string` instead of `char list`. The signature of various interfaces are updated accordingly.
- Extraction now extracts Coq's binary integers (N/Z/positive) to ZArith's BigInt instead. The original conversion functions are therefore deprecated. New conversion functions between ZArith's BigInt and OCaml's native int are added. This is to avoid cyclic dependencies in the parametric SIMD implementations.
- The testing script `run_wast.sh` and the makefile now support testing a subset of the test suite by passing in a filter argument. For example: `make run_wast FILTER="simd"` runs only the simd tests.
