# Release 2.0.3

## New Features
- Adding support for passing arguments via the CLI.
- Adding native support for module import/export across multiple modules without manually saving the store states.

## Dependency Updates
- Updating the repository to work with MathComp version 2.x.

## BugFix
- Fixed a bug where `alloc_module` produces incorrect extern values in the export when the module also imports from the host. This bug was introduced during the 2.0 update when the `exportinsts` field was added to the module instance.

## Miscellaneous Enhancement
- The conversion between compcert byte and Coq byte now goes through binary integers instead of nat.
